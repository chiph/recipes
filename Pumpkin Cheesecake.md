# Pumpkin Cheesecake

## Ingredients

### __Crust__
* 1 3/4 C graham cracker crumbs
* 3 TB light brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 C melted salted butter

### __FILLING__
* 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature
* 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
* 3 eggs
* 1 egg yolk
* 1/4 C sour cream
* 1 1/4 C sugar
* 1/2 t ground cinnamon
* 1/8 t fresh ground nutmeg
* 1/8 t ground cloves
* 2 TB all-purpose flour
* 1 t vanilla extract

### __Directions__
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

2. In medium bowl, combine crumbs, sugar and cinnamon. Add melted butter. Press down flat into a 9-inch springform pan. Set aside.
   _Note: you may want to wrap the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a mess - I've had the butter from the crust ooze out; it's quite the mess._

3. Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add pumpkin puree, eggs, egg yolk, sour cream, sugar and the spices. Add flour and vanilla. Beat together until well combined.

4. Pour into crust. Spread out evenly and place oven for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let sit for 15 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.
